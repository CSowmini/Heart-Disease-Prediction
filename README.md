# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Heart Disease Prediction using KNeighborsClassifier and Random Forest Classifier


Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect your heart. Diseases under the heart disease umbrella include blood vessel diseases, such as coronary artery disease, heart rhythm problems (arrhythmia) and heart defects youâ€™re born with (congenital heart defects), among others.

I converted some categorical variables into dummy variables and scale all the values before training the Machine Learning models.

I have applied Machine Learning techniques to classify whether a person is suffering from Heart Disease or not.
